# Frizzante-Docker

## üêô Getting Started

> [!NOTE]  
> Frizzante Docker is A Docker-based installer and runtime for Frizzante.

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+).
1. Clone this project.
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:cmjoseph07/frizzante-docker.git && cd frizzante-docker
   ```
1. Build fresh images.
   ```sh
   docker compose build --pull --no-cache
   ```
1. Create a fresh Frizzante project and start the container.
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
   Subsequent runs of this command will simply start the container.
1. Attach to the container with your IDE or with your shell.
   ```sh
   docker exec -it frizzante-start sh
   ```
1. You can stop the container with
   ```sh
   docker compose down --remove-orphans
   ```

> [!TIP]
> As an alternative, instead of starting the container in background and attaching to it,
> you can directly start the development server inline.
> ```sh
> DEV=1 docker compose up
> ```
> However, this docker project doesn't integrate with [Go Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) for various reasons, 
> hence you won't be able to debug your application out of the box if you choose to develop this way.

## üöÄ Production with Docker

**Option 1: Build and run production binary inside container**
```sh
# Inside the container
frizzante --build
./.gen/bin/app
```

**Option 2: Build production Docker image**
```sh
docker build --target frizzante_prod -t my-app:prod .
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-app:prod
```

**Option 3: Use Docker Compose for production**
```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml up -d --build
```
